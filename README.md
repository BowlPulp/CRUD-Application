# CRUD Application
Feel free to contribute! ðŸŒˆâœ¨


**CRUD Application**   A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a software program or web application that performs the four basic operations on data within a database or storage system. These operations correspond to the key functions for managing and manipulating data records:
<br>
Create: This operation involves adding new data records to the system. Users can input information or data, and the application stores it in the database.
<br>
Read: In the "Read" operation, users can retrieve and view data from the database. It allows users to search for specific records, view individual data items, or generate reports based on the stored data.
<br>
Update: Users can modify existing data records in the "Update" operation. This includes editing or changing information within the database to reflect updated or corrected data.
<br>
Delete: The "Delete" operation allows users to remove data records from the system. This is typically done when data is no longer needed or is obsolete.
